	<p>Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by 
		flowering plants. Some flowers are dependent upon the 
		wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species.
		Their pollen grains are light-weight. Many others rely on
		insects or birds to move pollen</p>

		<p>Their stems are usually prickly and their glossy,
			green leaves have toothed edges. Rose flowers vary 
			in size and shape. They burst with colours ranging
			from pastel pink, peach, and cream, to vibrant yellow,
			orange, and red. Many roses are fragrant, and some produce
			berry-like fruits called hips</p>
